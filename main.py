    This application utilizes Google's Gemini 1.5-Flash model to generate captions for uploaded images. 
    Simply upload an image, and the model will provide a descriptive caption. Additionally, the caption 
    can be converted to speech and played back to you. The app demonstrates the power of generative AI in 
    providing meaningful descriptions for visual content, making it easier for users to understand the context 
    of their images.

    I am Aravind Kumar Y, pursuing a Master\'s Degree in Computer Science. This project is a demonstration of generating image captions using advanced Deep Learning models. I have Implemented this with using Generative AI of pre-trained Transformers model.
    I am dedicated to creating tools that enhance our interaction with technology and simplify complex tasks. 
    Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback on my work. This is helpful to train for future scope of using Generative AI models like Gemini Api Nano for Android and iOS applications.
